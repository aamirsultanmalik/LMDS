              Service Fees for Childcare Professional. Childcare Professionals
              who provide services through LastMinute Daycare Staffing shall
              receive payment through the service for all transactions related
              to that end user, including subsequent transactions not
              necessarily related to the initial request for services. If an end
              user is either unwilling or unable to make payment via Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing, Childcare Professional agrees to notify
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing of any new payment arrangement.
              Non-Circumvention Covenant. The parties acknowledge that
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing uses substantial labor and effort to
              connect end users with Childcare Professionals. Childcare
              Professional represents and warrants that it will not circumvent
              or attempt to circumvent Last-Minute Daycare Staffing or this
              Agreement, or in any way provide services for an end user outside
              of the Website, without Last-Minute Daycare Staffing’s prior
              written consent (“Non-Circumvention Covenant”). If Childcare
              Professional wishes to buyout the right to transact business
              directly with any specific end user that Childcare Professional
              met through the Website outside of the Website, then the Childcare
              Professional may make a proposal to Company and the parties shall
              negotiate a release from Company for that specific end user which
              shall only be approved at the mutual written agreement of both
              Company and Childcare Professional (“Buyout”). Failing the
              agreement of an approved Buyout, should Childcare Professional
              breach its Non-Circumvention Covenant, Childcare Professional
              shall pay Last-Minute Daycare Staffing a one-time fee equal to the
              greater of: 1) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Childcare
              Professional’s estimated annual compensation from end user
              calculated by Company based on previous end user payments; or 2)
              $10,000 as liquidated damages. 6. Indemnification By agreeing to
              the terms of this Agreement, You agree to indemnify, defend and
              hold harmless LastMinute Daycare Staffing and its affiliates,
              officers, directors, employees, stockholders, representatives and
              agents from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses or
              demands of liability, including attorneys' fees and costs incurred
              by them in connection with any claim by a third party (including
              an intellectual property claim) arising out of: (i) any breach by
              You of Your obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any willful
              misconduct or negligent act, omission or misrepresentation by You,
              Your agents or Your employees, (iii) any violation by You of any
              federal, state or local, law, rule or regulation, (iv) any
              disputes between You and any User, or (v) the violation or alleged
              violation of third-party intellectual property rights or
              proprietary rights by the materials and content you submit, post
              or transmit through the Website or otherwise provide to
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing for inclusion on the Website. You may
              not settle any claim subject to indemnification without the prior
              written consent of Last-Minute Daycare Staffing. In addition,
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing may, at its sole expense, participate
              in the defense and settlement of the claim. 7. Warranties;
              Disclaimers Warranties. Each party represents and warrants to the
              other party that (i) this Agreement constitutes a valid and
              binding obligation of such party, enforceable in accordance with

              does not violate any agreement or obligation existing between such
              party and any third party; (iv) the making of and performance of
              this Agreement does not infringe upon any third parties' rights
              and (v) each party shall, at all times, comply with all applicable
              federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances. You

              used under this Agreement; and (iv) any advertising copy or

              she professes or claims to be. You assume all risk when using the

              ATTEMPT TO DEFRAUD OR HARM YOU. 10. Waiver of Client Liability for
              Workplace Injuries In consideration of any engagement discovered
              through Last-Minute Daycare Staffing, Childcare Professional
              hereby acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the following
              will constitute terms and conditions of any such engagement. In
              recognition of the fact that any work related injuries which might
              be sustained by Childcare Professional may or may not be covered
              by state workers’ compensation statutes, and to avoid the
              circumvention of such state statutes that may result from suits
              against the users, if applicable, based on the same injury or
              injuries, and to the extent permitted by law, Childcare
              Professional, on Childcare Professional’s own behalf, hereby
              waives and forever releases any rights Childcare Professional
              might have to make claims or bring suit against Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing for damages based upon workplace injuries or
              illnesses sustained while on engagements with users. Childcare
              Professional agrees to notify Last-Minute Daycare Staffing if
              Childcare Professional believes that there are any unsafe
              conditions at the user’s worksite or facility. 11. Notices Unless
              otherwise specified herein, in the enrollment process or on our
              Website, any notice by one party hereto to the other shall be in
              writing (which may include email) and either personally delivered,

              courier or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt
              requested. Notices will be sent to you at the Internet email
              address or the mailing address specified in your account profile
              and to us at [Last-Minute Daycare Staffing], Attn.: Legal
              Department. All paper notices will be deemed effective on the date
              of personal delivery, upon signed receipt from an overnight
              courier, or five days after deposit with the U.S. Postal Service,
              as applicable. All email notices will be deemed effective when

              Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing and affects your rights. It contains
              procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION
              WAIVER. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and
              disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
              relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use
              of any product or service provided by Last-Minute Daycare Staffing
              that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall
              be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under
              the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed
              to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This
              Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Last-Minute Daycare
              Staffing, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
              predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns. Notice
              Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party
              may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party
              a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and
              basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice
              to Last-Minute Daycare Staffing should be sent to: [Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing], Attn.: Legal Department. After the Notice is
              received, you and Last-Minute Daycare Staffing may attempt to
              resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
              (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
              arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by
              any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
              arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to
              which either party is entitled. Arbitration Rules. Arbitration
              shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association
              (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider
              (“ADR Childcare Professional”) that offers arbitration as set
              forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the
              parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Childcare
              Professional. The rules of the ADR Childcare Professional shall
              govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited
              to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except
              to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The
              arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.
              Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
              is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
              resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the
              option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where
              the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
              (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined
              by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by
              the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
              jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including
              attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration
              and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR
              Childcare Professional. Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based
              Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
              arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based
              solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen
              by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
              involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
              otherwise agreed by the parties. Time Limits. If you or
              Last-Minute Daycare Staffing pursue arbitration, the arbitration
              action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
              limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and
              within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent
              claim. Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the
              arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you
              and Last-Minute Daycare Staffing, and the dispute will not be
              consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases
              or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
              motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
              shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
              any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
              applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall
              issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
              essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
              including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator
              has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that
              a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
              is final and binding upon you and Last-Minute Daycare Staffing.
              Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
              CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
              TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all
              claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
              Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more
              limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a
              court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the
              event any litigation should arise between you and Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate
              or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND LAST-MINUTE
              DAYCARE STAFFING WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
              electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. Waiver of Class
              or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE
              OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON
              AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE
              THAN PROVIDER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
              CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER PROVIDER. Confidentiality.
              All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not
              limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith,
              shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
              confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph
              shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
              information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
              arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
              Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement
              are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court
              of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall
              be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder
              of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Right to
              Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this
              Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
              claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
              portion of this Arbitration Agreement. Survival of Agreement. This
              Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
              relationship with Last-Minute Daycare Staffing. Small Claims
              Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Last-Minute
              Daycare Staffing may bring an individual action in small claims
              court. Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

              to select available Childcare Professionals from the Website to
              fill available temporary employment needs (the “Job”) and shall
              provide the Childcare Professional with a description of the work
              to be performed, the dates and times (6-hour minimum), the person
              to whom the Childcare Professional shall report, and other
              information needed for the Job (“Job Description”). 2.2 It is
              Childcare Facility’s sole responsibility to select the specific
              Childcare Professional of Childcare Facility’s choice. 2.3 Once
              chosen by Childcare Facility, the Childcare Professional shall be
              notified by the Website of the Job and shall confirm the Childcare
              Professional’s acceptance of the Job. Company shall then process
              the order in accordance with Childcare Facility’s payment method
              with Company’s third-party payment processor (i.e. credit or debit
              cards through payment service providers like Stripe, and/or
              others) and an authorization hold shall be placed on the Childcare
              Facility’s credit or debit card pending the completion of the Job,
              at which time the payment shall be finalized. 2.4 The completion

              hours worked and 6 hours, provided that any pre-authorized amount
              of time in excess of 6 hours that was not completed shall be
              credited against the final fee. Please note that closing out a Job
              prior to the expiration time for any reason does not and will not

              the Job 2.5 Childcare Facility acknowledges and agrees that all
              Jobs are subject to additional charges above the pay rates in the

              of this Agreement and the suspension of access to the Website. 10.

              Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments to the
              other party hereunder), when and to the extent such failure or
              delay is caused by or results from acts beyond the affected
              party's reasonable control, including, without limitation: acts of
              God; flood, fire, earthquake, or explosion; war, invasion,
              hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or
              act, riot, or other civil unrest; actions, embargoes, or blockades
              in effect on or after the date of this Agreement; national or
              regional emergency; compliance with any law or governmental order,
              rule, regulation, or direction, or any action taken by a

              imposing an embargo, export or import restriction, quota, or other
              6 restriction or prohibition, or failing to grant a necessary
              license or consent; strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns, or
              other industrial disturbances; shortage of adequate power or
              telecommunications or transportation facilities; or any other
              event which is beyond the reasonable control of such party (each
              of the foregoing, a "Force Majeure Event"). A party whose
              performance is affected by a Force Majeure Event shall give notice
              to the other party within three (3) days of the Force Majeure
              Event, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to
              continue. 20.2 During the Force Majeure Event, the non-affected
              party may similarly suspend its performance obligations until such
              time as the affected party resumes performance. 20.3 The affected
              party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and
              ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized and
              shall resume performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably
              practicable after the removal of the cause. 21. Miscellaneous.
              21.1 Each party shall, upon the request of the other party,
              promptly execute such documents and perform such acts as may be
              necessary to give full effect to the terms of this Agreement. 21.2
              This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
              their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
              herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
              any other person any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy
              of any nature whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement.
              21.3 Neither party may assign, transfer, or delegate any or all of
              its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
              written consent of the other party. No assignment shall relieve
              the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
              attempted assignment, transfer, or other conveyance in violation
              of the foregoing shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be
              binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
              and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 21.4 This
              Agreement may only be amended, modified, or supplemented by an
              agreement in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver by any
              party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
              explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so
              waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no
              failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy,
              power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or
              be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
              exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder
              preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
              any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. 21.5 If any term or
              provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
              in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
              unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
              this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
              provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that
              any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
              the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
              Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the parties as
              closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
              the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
              contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 7 21.6 This
              Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein
              by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the
              parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter
              contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
              understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect
              to such subject matter. 21.7 This Agreement may be executed in
              counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
              of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
              agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by email,
              facsimile or other means of electronic transmission shall be
              deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original
              signed copy of this Agreement. [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS] 8 IN
